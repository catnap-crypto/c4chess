## in depth info about my current development

Im working on making this project more suitable. I like this project, and as of right now the code does somehow work.
The only problem is that right now the code is written very badly. Let me clear this statement:

The code is written good for a small project, and this one is not in this category. I need to separate a lot of hard-code to something more useful for any long term idea/concept. In this case, i would like to make it more good looking. But there are many troubles, as of many global variables still running under memory, so problably there are a lot of use-after-free vulnerabilities, for example, after some time playing with it, the game crashes, under segmentation fault.

My idea is to separate make another version of this game, for every day use (more details soon:tm:). So, to start do it, i will open a new branch of this repo, with a lot of reimplamantation in a better way, for example, how to manage a chessboard, the core, where at the end of the day, every piece of code goes throw, managing better the pointers, unallocating the pieces initialized, create a more friendly code to work better, even for later use. As of right now, the game works, badly, because i didnt know where to start. 

Anyway, if you like my game, or the idea behind, and you want to contribute, heres a list i would likely need for this game:

- Server management
- Designer
- Mechanics management
- ~~A team~~ :)

if you want to know more information, or you want to contact me, feel free to send me a message at Discord at Waifro#4890, i will try to reply as soon as possible
Thanks for listening ðŸ‘‹
